# --- Merge conflict resolution notes (added) ---
# If you see a red exclamation or conflict badge after resolving a file:
# 1) Make sure no conflict markers remain in files (look for <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
#    Example check: grep -Rn '^[<>=]\{7\}' .
# 2) Stage the resolved file(s):
#    git add path/to/file
# 3) Finish the operation:
#    - For merges: git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
#    - For rebases: git rebase --continue
# 4) If the badge persists in VS Code, reload the window (Developer: Reload Window) or run:
#    git status
# 5) If Git reports an index lock, remove it and retry:
#    rm -f .git/index.lock
# This checklist is informational only and does not affect ignored files.
